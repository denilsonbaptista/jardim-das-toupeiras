### About

Project developed during stage 3 - Moving forward in HTML and CSS, in [Rocketseat](https://github.com/Rocketseat) explorer course.  

The idea of this project is to put into practice everything that was seen in the third phase of the explorer and make the moles get excited.

Scenery was set up with animations with CSS keyframes to make the moles appear in the field.
